## CodingBat problems - done 100%.
## Homework solutions:

| No | Task | Solution |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| HW1       | Create a traffic lights. For input 0-3 output is "Green", 4-5 - "Yellow", 6-10 - "Red". | [Traffic lights][HwTl] |
| HW2       | Create an immutable class. Make some objects, look how it works.                        | [Immutable class][HwIe] |
| HW3       | Generate a random char array of length based on user input. Make 2 output strategies: A - every even row and column, B - every odd. | [Arrays][HwAr] |
| HW4       | Create a pyramid builder program | [Pyramid][HwPb] |
| HW5       | Create a program, what: 1) generates a new string from the input using even\odd chars 2) generates a new string by index input 3) swaps two chars in entered positions 4) flips words in string | [Strings][HwSt] |
| HW6       | Recursion. Create a program for: 1) finding a fibonacci sequence 2) finding a power of num 3) counting a num of digits in number | [Recursion][HwRe] |
| HW7       | Annotations. Create your own annotation with String name and String age. Attach it to the clas then using reflection set fields of Person object with data from the annotation. Use Lombok. | [Annotations][HwAn] |
| HW8       | Files. The goal is to measure and compare runtime using buffered and standard file reader/writer | [Files][HwFi] |
| HW9       | Java 8 part 1. Create your own functional interfaces like BiFunction and Supplier (Producer). Create any class with several fields. Create a method which uses functional interfaces as a parameters. Using this method get fields, do some operations and return the result.  | [Java 8.1][HwJo] |
| HW10      | Java 8 part 2. Get the package from this [link][HwRr] and implement streams in the StreamOperations class. | [Java 8.2][HwJt] |
| HW11      | Multi threading. We have 1 bank, several ATMs and users. Create an ATMs simulation what simulates their behavior in multi threading style.  | [Multi threading][HwMt] |
| HW12      | Sea battle. Develop your own sea battle game with standard rules. | [Sea battle][HwSb] |
