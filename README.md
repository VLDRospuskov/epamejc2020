- Task

Create a traffic light that outputs a color signal.

At the input, the program takes the number of minutes from 0 to 10: 0-3 -> green, 4-5 -> yellow, 6-10 -> red.

```
Out: Print integer value between 0 and 10 to change color of traffic light or 'exit' to close the program
In: 0
Out: Traffic Light : GREEN
In: 5
Out: Traffic Light : YELLOW
In: not a number
Out: Wrong Input!For input string: "not a number"
In: 10
Out: Traffic Light : RED
In: exit
Out: Bye-bye!
```
