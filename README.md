## [The Traffic Light.]
   -Write a programm shows the traffic light color depending from entered number.
    For example:
        Input: 1
        Output: GREEN
## [My Immutable class.]
   -Create an immutable class. And test it.
## [Multiple Array builder.]
   -Create a multiple array and fill it with random characters. Size of array depends of passed parameters.
    For example:
        createArray(4, 3);
        Output: a c j
                i o t
                l y q
                h t e

   -Depends of created array use the strategy to print even(every seconds lines and chars in lines) or odd(every first lines and chars in lines) chars from the array.
    For example:
        even: ot
        odd: ajlq

   -Create a multiple array (size depends passed parameters) and print it to console. Array should locks like a pyramid.
   For example:
        pyramid(10);
        output: 0000000000
                000000000
                00000000
                0000000
                000000
                00000
                0000
                000
                00
                0
## [String Changer.]
   -Read line from console. Save it and then:
        -Display in console even or odd chars from this string based on user input.
        -Generate new string from chars of saved string.
        -Swap chars in saved string depends of user input.
        -Reverse saved string.
## [Recursions.]
   -Create a recursions methods:
        -Display in console fibonacci number.
        -Display in console exponent.
        -Count number of digints and display in console.
## [My Annotation.]
   -Create your own annotation with parameters name and age. Attach it to class constructor. Use reflection to initialize class fileds y annotation fields.
## [Work with files.]
   -Create two methods wich copies a files. Frist, just FileReader. Second, with BufferedReader. Measure the execution time of both methods.
## [Java 8]
    Work with Functional interfaces and Stream API.
### [Functional Interfaces]
   -Create your own Supplier and BiFunction and use it.
### [Stream API]
   -Implement streams in the StreamOperations class.
## [Threads]
   -Create a simulation of ATMs process. There are several ATMs. Each has own bank account. And there is Central Storage(reserve).
    When ATM don`t have enough cash in it, it take some cash from reserve. If ATM has a lot of cash, it put cash to resreve.
    Several users perform operations with this ATMs. (deposit, withdraw, check balace).
## [Sea Battle]
   -Classic Sea Battle game. There are two game modes: One Player(player vs bot) and Two Players (player vs player).
    You can set ships manually or automatically.
## [Tests]
   -Some tests of code.
