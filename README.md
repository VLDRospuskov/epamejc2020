## Homeworks: 

| Number | Link to the solution   | Description |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| ![N1]  | [Traffic lights][Hw1]  | Create the "traffic light", which outputs a color signal. You enter the time from 0-3 minutes-green, 4-5 minutes-yellow, 6-10 red. Enter the number from 0 to n and get the result.  Make the program work continuously. |
| ![N2]  | [Immutable class][Hw2] | Create an immutable class. |
| ![N3]  | [Arrays][Hw3]  |           |
|        | [Generation the string from char array][Hw3.1] | 1. Create an array of arrays, set a dimension based on which random character values are generated. 
|        | [Generation the string from char array with strategies A or B][Hw3.2] | 2. Generate an array of arrays specifying the dimension, fill it with random characters. Write 2 strategies that will form the string based on this array. Strategy A-works on the principle of x_x_x, and strategy B-works on the principle of _ x_ x_. |
|        | [Pyramid][Hw3.3] | 3. Make the program which will be generate a pyramid. |
| ![N4]  | [Strings][Hw4] |            |
|        | [Generation the string (even/odd)][Hw4.1] | 1. Create the program that generates the new string based on input data, string + even/odd. |
|        | [Generation the string by indexes][Hw4.2] | 2. Create the program that will generate the string by indexes. | 
|        | [Swap characters in a string][Hw4.3] | 3. Swap the characters in a string, the input is a string and 2 indexes between that need to be exchanged. |
|        | [Turning words over][Hw4.4] | 4. Create the program that turns words over, but leaves them in their original places. |
| ![N5]  | [Recursion][Hw5]  |           |
|        | [Fibonacci numbers][Hw5.1] | 1. Searching for a Fibonacci numbers. |
|        | [The power of a number][Hw5.2] | 2. Create the program to calculate the power of a number. |
|        | [Number of digits][Hw5.3] | 3. Create the program to count number of digits. |
