homework1.task1 -  Create a “traffic light” that outputs a signal-color. You enter a time from 0-3 minutes 
                   - the program displays "green", 4-5 minutes - "yellow", 6-10 - "red". 
                   
homework2.task1 -  Create your own immutable class.

homework3.task1 -  Create an array of arrays. The user enters dimensions and the program generates random char 
                   characters. 
                   Example:
                   Input: 4 2
                   Output:
                   k c
                   b p
                   b h
                   h g     
                   
homework3.task2 -  Generate an array of arrays. Indicate the dimension, fill it with random characters. Write 
                   2 strategies that will form a string based on this array. Strategy A - works on the principle 
                   of * _ * _ *, and Strategy B - works on the principle of _ * _ * _. 
                   Example:
                   Input: 5 5
                   Output: 
                   d a l p j 
                   v c b z g 
                   a d l r f 
                   f d m x h 
                   k d l h b 
                   Input strategy: A
                   Output: dljalfklb
                   
homework3.task3 -  Write a program that will generate a pyramid. 
                   Example:                   
                   Input: 10
                   Output: 
                   XXXXXXXXXX
                   XXXXXXXXX
                   XXXXXXXX
                   XXXXXXX
                   XXXXXX
                   XXXXX
                   XXXX
                   XXX
                   XX
                   X

                   Input: 6
                   Output: HoW
                 
homework4.task3 -  Write a program that swaps the characters in the string. The user enters a string and 2 indexes 
                   between which to exchange. 
                   Example:                                    
                   Input: Hello World
