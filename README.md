Write program that calculates a color of traffic light depending on the input minutes.\
0 - 3: Green color\
4 - 5 minutes: Yellow\
6 - 10 minutes: Red

#Homework 2 - Immutable Class
Create Immutable class and try to work with it
#Homework 3 - Arrays
##3.1
Create chars array of arrays, which size is based on user input\
\
Example:
Input: 4 2\
Output:\
k c\
b p\
b h\
h g

##3.2
Create string from two dimensional array using one of two strategies. The first one ('A') collects new string using
 every
 odd character in every odd line. The second one ('B') collects new string using every even character in every even
  line.\
  \
 Example:\
 input: 5 5\
 output:\
 d a l p j\
 v c b z g\
 a d l r f\
 f d m x h\
 k d l h b\
 input strategy: A\
 output: dljalfklb

##3.3
Make a program, which can generate pyramid of chars of given length, using user input\
\
Example:\
input: 10\
output:\
XXXXXXXXXX\
XXXXXXXXX\
XXXXXXXX\
XXXXXXX\
XXXXXX\
XXXXX\
XXXX\
XXX\
XX\
X

#Homework 4 - Strings
##4.1
Make a program, that generate new string based on input string and strategy
Strategy can be "even" or "odd". Even strategy collects every even char from input string and Odd strategy collects
 every odd character from input\
 \
 Example\
Input: String        Input: even        output: tig

##4.2
Create the program that will generate the string by indexes.\
\
Example:\
Input: Hello World\
input: 0  output: H\
input: 4  output: Ho\
input: 6  output: HoW

##4.3
Swap the characters in a string, the input is a string and 2 indexes between that need to be swapped.\
\
Example:\
Input: Hello World\
Input: 0, 4\
Output: oellH World

##4.4
Create the program that reverse letters in words, but keep words in their original places.


#Homework 5 - Recursion
##5.1
Calculate Fibonacci number using its index from user input. 
##5.2
Create a program that can rise an inputted number to the inputted power:\
\
Example:\
input number: 4\
input pow: 3\
output: 64

##5.3
Create the program to count number of digits.\
\
Example:\
input: 567\
output: 3

#Homework 6 - Annotations
Create your own annotation, where "name" will be "String" and "age" will be "int". Use this annotation with
 constructor, so the Field name takes name string from annotation and Field age takes age int from annotation.

#Homework 7 - Reader comparision
Make a program that compares required time for BufferedReader and FileReader to read an enormous text files

#Homework 8 - Stream operations
Implement required methods using Stream API

#Homework 9 - Functional interfaces
Write your own functional interfaces like BiFunction and Supplier (Producer).
Create a method that will take functional interfaces created earlier.

#Homework 10 - Multithreading
We have 1 general account (balance), there are several ATMs that work with this account. There are also several users. who will go to these ATMs, replenish / withdraw .

#Battleship game
Write a game "Sea Battle" in which you can play both in the Person vs. Person mode or in the Person vs. Machine mode
