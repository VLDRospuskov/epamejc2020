## Homeworks: 

| Number | Link to the solution   | Description |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| ![N1]  | [Traffic lights][Hw1]  | Create the "traffic light", which outputs a color signal. You enter the time from 0-3 minutes-green, 4-5 minutes-yellow, 6-10 red. Enter the number from 0 to n and get the result.  Make the program work continuously. |
| ![N2]  | [Immutable class][Hw2] | Create an immutable class. |
| ![N3]  | [Arrays][Hw3]  |           |
|        | [Generation the string from char array][Hw3.1] | 1. Create an array of arrays, set a dimension based on which random character values are generated. 
|        | [Generation the string from char array with strategies A or B][Hw3.2] | 2. Generate an array of arrays specifying the dimension, fill it with random characters. Write 2 strategies that will form the string based on this array. Strategy A-works on the principle of x_x_x, and strategy B-works on the principle of _ x_ x_. |
|        | [Pyramid][Hw3.3] | 3. Make the program which will be generate a pyramid. |
| ![N4]  | [Strings][Hw4] |            |
|        | [Generation the string (even/odd)][Hw4.1] | 1. Create the program that generates the new string based on input data, string + even/odd. |
|        | [Generation the string by indexes][Hw4.2] | 2. Create the program that will generate the string by indexes. | 
|        | [Swap characters in a string][Hw4.3] | 3. Swap the characters in a string, the input is a string and 2 indexes between that need to be exchanged. |
|        | [Turning words over][Hw4.4] | 4. Create the program that turns words over, but leaves them in their original places. |
| ![N5]  | [Recursion][Hw5]  |           |
|        | [Fibonacci numbers][Hw5.1] | 1. Searching for a Fibonacci numbers. |
|        | [The power of a number][Hw5.2] | 2. Create the program to calculate the power of a number. |
|        | [Number of digits][Hw5.3] | 3. Create the program to count number of digits. |
| ![N6]  | [Annotations][Hw6] | Create your own annotation, where "name" will be "String" and "age" will be "int". Use this annotation with constructor. When we create empty constructor, we must take data from the annotation through reflexion, and use it when we will be initialized an object. Use Lombok. |
| ![N7]  | [Work with files][Hw7] | Create a file, fill it with text (a lot of text), then read it and write it to another file. Make the second method the same only with buffered. Measure the execution time without buffered and with buffered. |
| ![N8]  | [Java 8][Hw8]  |           |
|        | [My functional interfaces][Hw8.1] | 1. Write your own functional interfaces according to the type of BiFunction and Supplier(Producer). Create a class with multiple fields. Create a method that accepts functional interfaces that were created earlier. Get two fields and process the received values and return them. |
|        | [Implement streams][Hw8.2] | 2. Implement streams in class StreamOperations. |
| ![N9]  | [ATMs][Hw9]  | We have one shared account, there are several ATMs that work with this account - they are located in different parts of the city , but the virtual account is shared. There are also several users who can Deposit / withdraw money . It is mandatory not to give out money in the negative. Each user has their own balance. If the ATM runs out of money, we add it from the shared resource , and if there is too much money in the ATM, we give it back to the resource. |
| ![N10]  | [Sea battle][Hw10]  | Write the sea battle of the standard, field 10 to 10. |
